A Ruby gem for getting a timeline view of Global VM Lock usage in your Ruby app that can be analyzed using the https://ui.perfetto.dev/[Perfetto UI].

For instructions and examples on how to use it, see my https://ivoanjo.me/blog/2023/07/23/understanding-the-ruby-global-vm-lock-by-observing-it/[RubyKaigi 2023 talk on "Understanding the Ruby Global VM Lock by observing it"].

NOTE: This gem only works on Ruby 3.2 and above because it depends on the https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/5500[GVL Instrumentation API]. Furthermore, the GVL Instrumentation API does not (as of this writing) currently work on Microsoft Windows.

== Quickest start

You can play with the output of running the following example:

[source,ruby]
----
require "gvl-tracing"

def fib(n)
  return n if n <= 1
  fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
end

GvlTracing.start("example1.json", os_threads_view_enabled: false) do
  Thread.new { sleep(0.05) while true }

  sleep(0.05)

  3.times.map { Thread.new { fib(37) } }.map(&:join)

  sleep(0.05)
end
----

To do so:

1. Download link:https://github.com/ivoanjo/gvl-tracing/blob/master/examples/example1.json.gz?raw=true[`examples/example1.json.gz`]
2. Navigate to https://ui.perfetto.dev/ and use the **Open trace file** option to load the file

== Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's `Gemfile` or `gems.rb` file by executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle add gvl-tracing
----

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install gvl-tracing
----

== Usage

Use `require "gvl-tracing"` to load the gem.

This gem only provides a single module (`GvlTracing`) with methods:

* `start(filename, &block)`: Starts tracing, writing the results to the provided filename. When a block is passed, yields the block and calls stop.
* `stop`: Stops tracing

The resulting traces can be analyzed by going to https://ui.perfetto.dev/[Perfetto UI].

=== What do each of the events mean?

The following events are shown in the timeline:

* `started_tracing`: First event, when `GvlTracing` is enabled
* `stopped_tracing`: Last event, when `GvlTracing` is disabled
* `started`: Ruby thread created
* `died`: Ruby thread died
* `wants_gvl`: Ruby thread is ready to execute, but needs the GVL before it can do so
* `running`: Ruby thread is running code (and owns the GVL)
* `waiting`: Ruby thread is waiting to be waken up when some event happens (IO, timeout)
* `gc`: Doing garbage collection
* `sleeping`: Thread called `Kernel#sleep`

Note that not all events come from the GVL instrumentation API, and some events were renamed vs the "RUBY_INTERNAL_THREAD_EVENT" entries.

== Experimental features

1. OS threads view: Pass in `os_threads_view_enabled: true` to `GvlTracing.start` to also render a view of Ruby thread activity from the OS native threads point-of-view. This is useful when using M:N thread scheduling, which is used on Ruby 3.3+ Ractors, and when using the `RUBY_MN_THREADS=1` setting.

== Tips

You can "embed" links to the perfetto UI which trigger loading of a trace by following the instructions on https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/deep-linking-to-perfetto-ui .

This way you can actually link from your dashboards and similar pages directly to a trace.

== Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org]. To run specs, run `bundle exec rake spec`.

To run all actions (build the extension, check linting, and run specs), run `bundle exec rake`.
